## Features

- *Prediction Model*: Uses machine learning (XGBoost) to classify customer subscription likelihood.
- *User-Friendly UI*: Built with Streamlit to allow non-technical users to input data and get predictions.
- *Data Visualization*: Insights into trends such as conversion rates, age-group analysis, and feature importance.
- *Offline Capability*: Batch processing of customer data in CSV files.

---

## Tech Stack

- *Programming Language*: Python
- *Machine Learning Libraries*: Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- *Data Visualization*: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- *Frontend Framework*: Streamlit
- *Model Serialization*: Joblib

# Data Pipeline

### 1. Data Preparation
- Load and explore the dataset using Pandas.
- Perform EDA to identify distribution, trends, and correlations.
- Clean data by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Scale and normalize numerical features.
- Create interaction terms and select relevant features.

### 3. Model Training
- Train models using Scikit-learn and XGBoost.
- Evaluate models with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

### 4. Fine-Tuning
- Perform hyperparameter optimization using Grid Search and Random Search.
- Experiment with advanced algorithms like LightGBM or Neural Networks (optional).
